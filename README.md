# Neat Datasets

Sometimes I want neat, easy-to-access datasets for teaching & exploring. Maybe you do, too! I'm collecting and publishing them here.

You can find visitation data about National Parks from 1979-2020 and from 2020 alone. This data was downloaded from [NPS Stats](https://irma.nps.gov/STATS/) (find the [1979-2020 report](https://irma.nps.gov/STATS/SSRSReports/National%20Reports/Query%20Builder%20for%20Public%20Use%20Statistics%20(1979%20-%20Last%20Calendar%20Year)), find the [2020 report](https://irma.nps.gov/STATS/SSRSReports/National%20Reports/Annual%20Park%20Ranking%20Report%20(1979%20-%20Last%20Calendar%20Year))).
